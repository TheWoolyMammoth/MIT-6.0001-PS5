# RSS Feed and News Alerts PS5
## Changelog:
* 06/19/2021: Completed problem 1 for PS5. Created the class *NewsStory* with the *__init__* method, and associated *getter* functions.
* 07/05/2021: Worked on problem 2. did not test work as i still need to implement problem 3 and problem 4 subclasses.
* 07/12/2021: completed *PhraseTrigger*, and its two subclasses (TitleTrigger, and DescriptionTrigger). Completed function *TimeTrigger* and its two subclasses(BeforeTrigger, AfterTrigger). Completed the functions *NotTrigger*,*AndTrigger*, *OrTrigger*. Tested all up to date componentes using *ps5_test.py*. All tests so far have been completed sucessfully.   
* 07/13/2021: Project complete. Apparently the Yahoo API is so out of date that I cannot use it to produce a RSS feed. Unable to complete remaining tasks. All tests however have completed. No additional work was done other than work on *Filter_Stories* but given the issues with the outdated API I am unable to test my code.
